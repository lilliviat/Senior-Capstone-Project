*This is an application that produces messages
*at one end of the data pipeline.
*This application will use stream processing, i.e.
* the visible boundary doesn't exist, for optimal data flow.

*The data pipeline is often referred to as a Topic in Kafka
*, and will be referred to as a topic for the remainder of this API.
